# brazilian_sign_language_translator_glove

This is a complete project aimed translating the Brazilian alphanumeric sign language.
We've attached five bend sensors and an MPU6050 to a glove.
Data were collected and sent to the application through a PIC18F4550 microcontroller.
Signals were classified using the KNN algorithm.
